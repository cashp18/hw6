# hyperparameters

The main hyperparameter that i tuned was the number of features. Using 2 for the number of features is what allowed me to get the accuracy and accuracy/feature at optimal percentages.
I used a loop to test 1-10 for number of features to find this information. I also tinkered with some of the other parameters and found that they did not significantly change the percentages.

# results

Average score after 5-fold cross validation: .958
Average score per feature: .479

# instructions

Just open jupyter notebook and run cells
